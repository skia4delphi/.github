# About Skia4Delphi
The project was founded by Paulo César Botelho Barbosa and Vinícius Felipe Botelho Barbosa, 
enthusiastic Delphi developers with over 15 years of programming experience. The library was 
made from developers to developers and we hope it helps and somehow adds value for everyone.
